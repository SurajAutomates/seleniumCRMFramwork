TakeScreenShot :
	TakesScreenshot is a built-in Java interface you use when you want to take screenshots of the browser 
	during automated tests.
	
How It Works ? 
1. Cast your WebDriver instance to TakesScreenshot (because WebDriver itself doesn’t include the screenshot method):
	TakesScreenshot screenshot = (TakesScreenshot) driver;
	
2. Capture the screenshot using getScreenshotAs() and specify an output type:
	File srcFile = screenshot.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
	
3. Save the screenshot to disk using file handling utilities like FileUtils.copyFile()
	File srcFile = ((TakesScreenshot)driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
	File destFile = new File("screenshot.png");

	// Save the file
	FileUtils.copyFile(srcFile, destFile);	
	

JavaScriptExecutor : 
	JavaScriptExecutor is an interface in Selenium WebDriver that lets you run raw JavaScript code inside the browser
	while your automation test is running. It’s especially helpful when normal WebDriver commands (like click() or 
	sendKeys()) don’t work on a web page due to dynamic elements, overlays, or complex scripts.	
	
Main Methods: 	
executeScript(String script, Object... args)
	Runs synchronous JavaScript and can return values (like title, text, numbers, elements).

executeAsyncScript(String script, Object... args)
	Runs asynchronous JavaScript where you must signal completion via a callback (useful for AJAX waits).
